Description: An implementation of DÃ­az, Rau and Rivera (2015) matching estimator for causal inference.
  The authors propose a matching estimator based on a Bilevel Optimization Problem. In raw terms,
  the two problems are (1) finding a convex combination that (2) using the closets neighbors possible.
  The solution to this problem allows computing Treatment Effect estimators that significantly improve
  balance in case-control studies, and furthermore, can be used for data imputation.
